  abstract = {Influenza is a highly contagious viral pathogen with more than 200,000 cases reported in the United States during the 2017--2018 season. Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization, with the goal to reduce influenza severity and transmission. Currently available vaccines are about 60\% effective, and vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season, as well as between different influenza subtypes within a single season. Immunological imprinting from early-life influenza infection can prominently shape the immune response to subsequent infections. Here, the impact of preexisting B cell memory in the response to quadrivalent influenza vaccine was assessed using blood samples collected from healthy subjects (18--85 years old) prior to and 21--28 days following influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination increased both HA-specific antibodies and memory B cell frequency. Despite no apparent differences in antigenicity between vaccine components, most individuals were biased toward one of the vaccine strains. Specifically, responses to H3N2 were reduced in magnitude relative to the other vaccine components. Overall, this study unveils a potentially new mechanism underlying differential vaccine effectiveness against distinct influenza subtypes.,  , People are imprinted with a bias to one of the four seasonal influenza subtypes that persists following seasonal influenza vaccination.},

Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce influenza severity and limit transmission through elicitation of antibodies targeting mainly the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of the influenza virus. Antibodies elicited by current seasonal influenza vaccines are predominantly strain-specific. However, continuous antigenic drift by circulating influenza viruses facilitates escape from pre-existing antibodies requiring frequent reformulation of the seasonal influenza vaccine. Traditionally, immunological responses to influenza vaccination have been largely focused on IgG antibodies, with almost complete disregard of other isotypes. In this report, young adults (18--34 years old) and elderly (65--85 years old) subjects were administered the split inactivated influenza vaccine for 3 consecutive seasons and their serological IgA and IgG responses were profiled. Moreover, correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between vaccine-induced IgA antibody titers and traditional immunological endpoints, exposing vaccine-induced IgA antibodies as an important novel immune correlate during influenza vaccination.},

We show that B cells and serum antibodies from inbred mice demonstrate a reproducible ID hierarchy to the five major antigenic sites in the influenza A virus hemagglutinin globular domain. The hierarchy changed as the immune response progressed, and it was dependent on antigen formulation and delivery. Passive antibody transfer and sequential infection experiments demonstrated 'original antigenic suppression', a phenomenon in which antibodies suppress memory responses to the priming antigenic site.

For influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), the immunodominance of the variable head impairs responses to the highly conserved stem. Here, we show that head immunodominance depends on the physical attachment of head to stem. Stem immunogenicity is enhanced by immunizing with stem-only constructs or by increasing local HA concentration in the draining lymph node. Surprisingly, coimmunization of full-length HA and stem alters stem-antibody class switching.

  abstract = {Determining the duration of protective immunity requires quantifying the magnitude and rate of loss of antibodies to different virus and vaccine antigens. A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it affected the longevity of protective immunity to measles, rubella, vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold (95\% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others---on average, they have higher antibody levels with slower decay rates. We identified different patterns for the loss of protective levels of antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively, but about 10\% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only 1\% to 3\% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.},

Antigenic variation including glycan introduction or removal is among the mechanisms viruses have evolved to escape host immunity. Understanding how glycosylation affects immunodominance on complex protein antigens may help decipher underlying B cell biology. To determine how B cell responses can be altered by such modifications, we engineered glycans onto the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and characterized the molecular features of the elicited humoral immunity in mice. We found that glycan addition changed the initially diverse antibody repertoire into an epitope-focused, genetically restricted response. Structural analyses showed that one antibody gene family targeted a previously subdominant, occluded epitope at the head interface. Passive transfer of this antibody conferred Fc-dependent protection to influenza virus-challenged mice. These results have potential implications for next-generation viral vaccines aimed at directing B cell responses to preferred epitope(s).},

However, there is uncertainty about the mathematical appropriateness and the biological or clinical meaning of conventionally used parameters. Theoretical considerations and exploration of a data-set of 16 studies with an inactivated (subunit) influenza vaccine involving 1176 adult subjects suggest the following conclusions. In a population seronegative before vaccination, the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (post-GMT) is a meaningful immunological parameter adequately expressing antibody response after vaccination. The related protection rate (PR) is a good surrogate parameter for protection provided by a given vaccine, thus relevant to public health. However, in a population partially seropositive before vaccination (due to previous exposition to influenza antigens), the same parameters may, under certain conditions, seriously overestimate the antibody response, as they do not account for the pre-vaccination state. Conventional attempts to address pre-vaccination antibody are associated with either loss of information (exclusion of seropositive subjects) or incomplete control of pre-vaccination state (mean fold increase (MFI), response rate (RR)). Although not devoid of theoretical limitations (heteroscedasticity), correction of post-GMT and PR by linear regression appears to provide better estimates of antibody response and vaccine immunogenicity.},

  abstract = {Background The live attenuated 17DD Yellow Fever vaccine is one of the most successful prophylactic interventions for controlling disease expansion ever designed and utilized in larger scale. However, increase on worldwide vaccine demands and manufacturing restrictions urge for more detailed dose sparing studies. The establishment of complementary biomarkers in addition to PRNT and Viremia could support a secure decision-making regarding the use of 17DD YF vaccine subdoses. The present work aimed at comparing the serum chemokine and cytokine kinetics triggered by five subdoses of 17DD YF Vaccine. Methods Neutralizing antibody titers, viremia, cytokines and chemokines were tested on blood samples obtained from eligible primary vaccinees. Results and discussion The results demonstrated that a fifty-fold lower dose of 17DD-YF vaccine (587~IU) is able to trigger similar immunogenicity, as evidenced by significant titers of anti-YF PRNT. However, only subdoses as low as 3,013~IU elicit viremia kinetics with an early peak at five days after primary vaccination equivalent to the current dose (27,476~IU), while other subdoses show a distinct, lower in magnitude and later peak at day 6 post-vaccination. Although the subdose of 587~IU is able to trigger equivalent kinetics of IL-8/CXCL-8 and MCP-1/CCL-2, only the subdose of 3,013~IU is able to trigger similar kinetics of MIG/CXCL-9, pro-inflammatory (TNF, IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-2) and modulatory cytokines (IL-5 and IL-10). Conclusions The analysis of serum biomarkers IFN-{$\gamma$} and IL-10, in association to PRNT and viremia, support the recommendation of use of a ten-fold lower subdose (3,013~IU) of 17DD-YF vaccine.},

In this study, volunteers (aged 18--85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated FluzoneTM in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016. The impact of repeat vaccination on breadth and durability of functional antibodies was assessed for total IgG and IgA antihemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity against both influenza B lineages. Many subjects were able to maintain high seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains in subsequent years, which resulted in low vaccine-induced seroconversion rates. This was especially evident in younger subjects who typically had higher titers and maintained these titers into the following season. In contrast, the HAI titers in elderly subjects were generally lower and more likely to decline prior to the start of the next influenza season. Immunological recall or `back-boosting' to antigenically related viruses was associated with seroconversion. Overall, influenza vaccination in both younger and older people elicited broadly reactive immune responses within a lineage, as well as crossreactive immune responses between lineages. This study exemplified the impact that age and influenza exposure history have on determining an individual's ability to respond to future influenza infections.},

  abstract = {Pre-existing immunity to influenza is dependent on a number of factors and can vary greatly within and across influenza subtypes. In this study, volunteers (aged 18--85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated FluzoneTM in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016. The impact of repeat vaccination on breadth and durability of functional antibodies was assessed for total IgG and IgA antihemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity against both influenza B lineages. Many subjects were able to maintain high seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains in subsequent years, which resulted in low vaccine-induced seroconversion rates. This was especially evident in younger subjects who typically had higher titers and maintained these titers into the following season. In contrast, the HAI titers in elderly subjects were generally lower and more likely to decline prior to the start of the next influenza season. Immunological recall or `back-boosting' to antigenically related viruses was associated with seroconversion. Overall, influenza vaccination in both younger and older people elicited broadly reactive immune responses within a lineage, as well as crossreactive immune responses between lineages. This study exemplified the impact that age and influenza exposure history have on determining an individual's ability to respond to future influenza infections.},

This study examined the safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent high-dose split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD). METHODS: This was a randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial in healthy adults {$\geq$}65\,years of age. Subjects were randomized in a 4:1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular injection of IIV4-HD, the licensed IIV3-HD, or an IIV3-HD containing the alternate B-lineage strain. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), seroneutralisation, and anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were measured at baseline and day 28. Solicited reactions were collected for up to 7\,days, unsolicited adverse events up to 28\,days, and serious adverse events up to 180\,days. The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates that are non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HD. Secondary objectives were to describe the safety of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD and to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates that are superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain. RESULTS: The study included 2670 adults {$\geq$}65\,years of age. For all four strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HDs containing the same strains. For both B strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain. Seroneutralisation and anti-neuraminidase antibody responses, measured in a subset of subjects, were similar. No new safety concerns were identified, and the safety profiles of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second B strain in IIV4-HD resulted in improved immunogenicity against the added strain without compromising the immunogenicity of the other strains or the vaccine's tolerability.

After adjusting the different cohorts for the probability of vaccination conditional on patients' characteristics, we compared 30-day mortality rate post-influenza among older adults who experienced breakthrough infection after receipt of HD or SD influenza vaccines and among those not vaccinated (NV).We evaluated 44 456 influenza cases: 23 109 (52\%) were unvaccinated, 15 037 (33.8\%) received HD vaccine, and 6310 (14.2\%) received SD vaccine. Significant reductions in mortality rates among breakthrough cases were observed across all 3 seasons for HD vs NV, ranging from 17\% to 29\% reductions. A significant mortality reduction of 25\% was associated with SD vaccination vs NV in the 2016--2017 season when there was a good match between circulating influenza viruses and selected vaccine strains. When comparing HD vs SD cohorts, mortality reductions were higher among those who received HD in the last 2 seasons when mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating H3N2 viruses was documented, albeit not significant.HD vaccination was associated with lower post-influenza mortality among older adults with breakthrough influenza, even during seasons when antigenically drifted H3N2 circulated. Improved understanding of the impact of different vaccines on attenuating disease severity is warranted when assessing vaccine policy recommendations.},

In this paper we construct point estimators of the bounds of random variables which are substantially better estimators than the extreme order statistics for many classes of random variables, including those whose distributions are truncated at one or both ends. We also construct confidence limits and tests of hypotheses for bounds. The main results are large sample results.},

An HI titre of 1:40 is generally accepted to correspond to a 50\% reduction in the risk of contracting influenza in a susceptible population, but limited attempts have been made to further quantify the association between HI titre and protective efficacy.We present a model, using a meta-analytical approach, that estimates the level of clinical protection against influenza at any HI titre level. Source data were derived from a systematic literature review that identified 15 studies, representing a total of 5899 adult subjects and 1304 influenza cases with interval-censored information on HI titre. The parameters of the relationship between HI titre and clinical protection were estimated using Bayesian inference with a consideration of random effects and censorship in the available information.A significant and positive relationship between HI titre and clinical protection against influenza was observed in all tested models. This relationship was found to be similar irrespective of the type of viral strain (A or B) and the vaccination status of the individuals.Although limitations in the data used should not be overlooked, the relationship derived in this analysis provides a means to predict the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines when only immunogenicity data are available. This relationship can also be useful for comparing the efficacy of different influenza vaccines based on their immunological profile.},

Methods: A phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted to compare High-Dose (HD) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (60 ␮g of hemagglutinin [HA] per strain) to standard dose (SD) vaccine (15 ␮g of HA per strain) in adults {$\geq$}65 years of age. Assessments of safety (serious adverse events [SAE]), immunogenicity (hemagglutination inhibition [HAI] titers) and relative efficacy were performed during the 2009--2010 influenza season, which coincided with the H1N1 pandemic. Results: A total of 9172 participants were enrolled in 99 research centers in the US (6117 and 3055 randomized to the HD and SD groups, respectively). Within 180 days after vaccination, 6.7\% and 6.5\% of participants in the HD and SD vaccine groups, respectively, experienced at least one SAE, of which 0.4\% and 0.3\% had a fatal outcome. A total of 0.5\% of participants in both groups discontinued the study due to a SAE. Post-vaccination HAI titers and rate of post-vaccination HAI titer {$\geq$}1:40 were significantly higher in the HD group. No cases of influenza caused by viral types/subtypes similar to those in the vaccines were observed. All cases genetically or antigenically characterized were classified as similar to influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the pandemic strain. The vaccine efficacy of HD vaccine relative to SD vaccine against any influenza viral type/subtype was 12.6\% (95\% CI -140.5; 65.8) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Conclusion: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and well tolerated and provides superior immune responses compared to standard dose vaccine.

METHODS: We conducted a phase IIIb-IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to compare IIV3-HD (60 {$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain) with standard-dose trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD [15 {$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain]) in adults 65 years of age or older. Assessments of relative efficacy, effectiveness, safety (serious adverse events), and immunogenicity (hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] titers) were performed during the 2011-2012 (year 1) and the 2012-2013 (year 2) northern-hemisphere influenza seasons. RESULTS: A total of 31,989 participants were enrolled from 126 research centers in the United States and Canada (15,991 were randomly assigned to receive IIV3-HD, and 15,998 to receive IIV3-SD). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 228 participants in the IIV3-HD group (1.4\%) and 301 participants in the IIV3-SD group (1.9\%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any viral type or subtype associated with a protocol-defined influenza-like illness (relative efficacy, 24.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 36.5). At least one serious adverse event during the safety surveillance period was reported by 1323 (8.3\%) of the participants in the IIV3-HD group, as compared with 1442 (9.0\%) of the participants in the IIV3-SD group (relative risk, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.99). After vaccination, HAI titers and seroprotection rates (the percentage of participants with HAI titers {$\geq$} 1:40) were significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group. Conclusions: Among persons 65 years of age or older, IIV3-HD induced significantly higher antibody responses and provided better protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness than did IIV3-SD.

Enrolled patients were tested for influenza, and receipt of influenza vaccine by type was recorded. Effectiveness of SD-IIV and HD-IIV was estimated using a test-negative design (comparing odds of influenza among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients). Relative effectiveness of SD-IIV and HD-IIV was estimated using logistic regression.Among 1487 enrolled patients aged {$\geq$}65 years, 1107 (74\%) were vaccinated; 622 (56\%) received HD-IIV, and 485 (44\%) received SD-IIV.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza-associated morbidity and mortality has not decreased in the last decade, despite increased receipt of vaccine. To improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine, a high-dose (HD) trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine was developed. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study was conducted to compare HD vaccine (which contains 60 microg of hemagglutinin per strain) with the licensed standard-dose (SD) vaccine (which contains 15 microg of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults {$>$} or = 65 years of age. RESULTS: HD vaccine was administered to 2575 subjects, and SD vaccine was administered to 1262 subjects. There was a statistically significant increase in the rates of seroconversion and mean hemagglutination inhibition titers at day 28 after vaccination among those who received HD vaccine, compared with those who received SD vaccine. Mean postvaccination titers for individuals who received HD vaccine were 116 for H1N1, 609 for H3N2, and 69 for B strain; for those who received SD vaccine, mean postvaccination titers were as 67 for H1N1, 333 for H3N2, and 52 for B strain. The HD vaccine met superiority criteria for both A strains, and the responses for B strain met non-inferiority criteria. Seroprotection rates were also higher for those who received HD vaccine than for those who received SD vaccine vaccine, for all strains. Local reactions were more frequent in individuals who received HD vaccine, but the reactions were mild to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant increase in the level of antibody response induced by HD influenza vaccine, compared with that induced by SD vaccine, without an attendant increase in the rate or severity of clinically relevant adverse reactions. These results suggest that the high-dose vaccine may provide improved protective benefits for older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00391053 .},

Several influenza vaccines include antigens that are produced through alternative systems, but a systematic comparison of different vaccines used during the 2017-2018 season has not been completed. METHODS: We compared antibody responses in humans vaccinated with Fluzone (egg-based, n = 23), Fluzone High-Dose (egg-based, n = 16), Flublok (recombinant protein-based, n = 23), or Flucelvax (cell-based, n = 23) during the 2017-2018 season. We completed neutralization assays using an egg-adapted H3N2 virus, a cell-based H3N2 virus, wild-type 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 H3N2 viruses, and the H1N1 vaccine strain. We also performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using a recombinant wild-type 3c2.A hemagglutinin. Antibody responses were compared in adjusted analysis. RESULTS: Postvaccination neutralizing antibody titers to 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 were higher in Flublok recipients compared with Flucelvax or Fluzone recipients (P {$<$} .01). Postvaccination titers to 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 were similar in Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose recipients, though seroconversion rates trended higher in Flublok recipients. Postvaccination titers in Flucelvax recipients were low to all H3N2 viruses tested, including the cell-based H3N2 strain. Postvaccination neutralizing antibody titers to H1N1 were similar among the different vaccine groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that influenza vaccine antigen match and dose are both important for eliciting optimal H3N2 antibody responses in humans. Future studies should be designed to determine if our findings directly impact vaccine effectiveness. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03068949.},

  abstract = {This report updates the 2019-20 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2019;68[No. RR-3]). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged {$\geq$}6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Most influenza vaccines available for the 2020-21 season will be quadrivalent, with the exception of MF59-adjuvanted IIV, which is expected to be available in both quadrivalent and trivalent formulations.Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 23, 2019; February 26, 2020; and June 24, 2020. Primary updates to this report include the following two items. First, the composition of 2020-21 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. Second, recent licensures of two new influenza vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent, are discussed. Both new vaccines are licensed for persons aged {$\geq$}65 years. Additional changes include updated discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccination and the accompanying Table, updated discussion concerning use of LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral medication use, and updated recommendations concerning vaccination of persons with egg allergy who receive either cell culture-based IIV4 (ccIIV4) or RIV4.The 2020-21 influenza season will coincide with the continued or recurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus associated with coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). Influenza vaccination of persons aged {$\geq$}6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html.This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2020-21 season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used within Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed indications. Updates and other information are available from CDC's influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu).

  abstract = {Background Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A is the main causative pathogen of meningitis epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, serogroup W135 has also been the cause of epidemics. Mass vaccination campaigns with polysaccharide vaccines are key elements in controlling these epidemics. Facing global vaccine shortage, we explored the use of fractional doses of a licensed A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine. Methods and Findings We conducted a randomized, non-inferiority trial in 750 healthy volunteers 2--19 years old in Mbarara, Uganda, to compare the immune response of the full dose of the vaccine versus fractional doses (1/5 or 1/10). Safety and tolerability data were collected for all subjects during the 4 weeks following the injection. Pre- and post-vaccination sera were analyzed by measuring serum bactericidal activity (SBA) with baby rabbit complement. A responder was defined as a subject with a {$\geq$}4-fold increase in SBA against a target strain from each serogroup and SBA titer {$\geq$}128. For serogroup W135, 94\% and 97\% of the vaccinees in the 1/5- and 1/10-dose arms, respectively, were responders, versus 94\% in the full-dose arm; for serogroup A, 92\% and 88\% were responders, respectively, versus 95\%. Non-inferiority was demonstrated between the full dose and both fractional doses in SBA seroresponse against serogroups W135 and Y, in total population analysis. Non-inferiority was shown between the full and 1/5 doses for serogroup A in the population non-immune prior to vaccination. Non-inferiority was not shown for any of the fractionate doses for serogroup C. Safety and tolerability data were favourable, as observed in other studies. Conclusions While the advent of conjugate A vaccine is anticipated to largely contribute to control serogroup A outbreaks in Africa, the scale-up of its production will not cover the entire ``Meningitis Belt'' target population for at least the next 3 to 5 years. In view of the current shortage of meningococcal vaccines for Africa, the use of 1/5 fractional doses should be considered as an alternative in mass vaccination campaigns.

  abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

  abstract = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

Eligible participants were recruited from communities and randomly assigned to one of eight groups, corresponding to the four vaccines at standard or fractional dose. The vaccine was administered subcutaneously by nurses who were not masked to treatment, but participants and other study personnel were masked to vaccine allocation. The primary outcome was proportion of participants with seroconversion 28 days after vaccination. Seroconversion was defined as post-vaccination neutralising antibody titres at least 4 times pre-vaccination measurement measured by 50\% plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT\textsubscript{50}). We defined non-inferiority as less than 10\% decrease in seroconversion in fractional compared with standard dose groups 28 days after vaccination.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immune responses after influenza immunization are reduced in elderly individuals, the group at greatest risk for complications and death after influenza. Improved vaccines are needed to address this problem. METHODS: Ambulatory individuals 65 years and older (N = 202) were assigned randomly to receive a single intramuscular injection of the 2001-2002 formulation of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15, 30, or 60 microg of hemagglutinin per strain (up to 180 microg total per dose) or placebo. Clinical and serologic responses were assessed during the month after immunization. RESULTS: Increasing dosages of vaccine elicited significantly higher serum antibody levels, frequencies of antibody responses, and putative protective titers after vaccination. Mean serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers 1 month after immunization in groups given 0-, 15-, 30-, and 60-microg dosages were 23, 37, 50, and 61 against influenza A/H1N1; 43, 86, 91, and 125 against influenza A/H3N2; and 10, 14, 18, and 24 against influenza B, respectively. Mean serum hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody levels against the 3 vaccine antigens in participants given the 60-microg dosage were 44\% to 71\% and 54\% to 79\%, respectively, higher than those in participants given the standard 15-microg dosage, and the 60-microg dosage level nearly doubled the frequency of antibody responses in those whose preimmunization antibody titers were in the lower half of the antibody range. Dose-related increases in the occurrence of injection site reactions were observed (P{$<$}.001), but all dosages were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The improved immunogenicity of high-dose influenza vaccine among elderly persons should lead to enhanced protection against naturally occurring influenza.},

  abstract = {Testing for differences between two groups is among the most frequently carried out statistical methods in empirical research. The traditional frequentist approach is to make use of null hypothesis significance tests which use p values to reject a null hypothesis. Recently, a lot of research has emerged which proposes Bayesian versions of the most common parametric and nonparametric frequentist two-sample tests. These proposals include Student's two-sample t-test and its nonparametric counterpart, the Mann--Whitney U test. In this paper, the underlying assumptions, models and their implications for practical research of recently proposed Bayesian two-sample tests are explored and contrasted with the frequentist solutions. An extensive simulation study is provided, the results of which demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian tests achieve better type I error control at slightly increased type II error rates. These results are important, because balancing the type I and II errors is a crucial goal in a variety of research, and shifting towards the Bayesian two-sample tests while simultaneously increasing the sample size yields smaller type I error rates. What is more, the results highlight that the differences in type II error rates between frequentist and Bayesian two-sample tests depend on the magnitude of the underlying effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness can vary from season to season due in part to the dominant circulating strains and antigenic matching. This study reviews the relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV) in adults aged~{$\geq~$}65~years against influenza-associated outcomes. Additional sub-analyses of HD-IIV3 rVE were performed by the predominantly circulating influenza strain and the antigenic match or mismatch of the vaccine against the predominant circulating strains. METHODS: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults aged~{$\geq~$}65~years. Results from individual seasons were extracted from the studies, and viral surveillance data were used to determine the dominant circulating strains and antigenic match for each season. Results were then stratified based on clinical outcomes and seasonal characteristics and meta-analyzed to estimate pooled rVEs of HD-IIV3. RESULTS: 15 publications were meta-analyzed after screening 1,293 studies, providing data on 10 consecutive influenza seasons and over 22 million individuals receiving HD-IIV3 in randomized and observational settings. Across all influenza seasons, HD-IIV3 demonstrated improved protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV (rVE~=~15.9\%, 95\% CI: 4.1-26.3\%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE~=~8.4\%, 95\% CI: 5.7-11.0\%), as well as influenza (rVE~=~11.7\%, 95\% CI: 7.0-16.1\%), pneumonia (rVE~=~27.3\%, 95\% CI: 15.3-37.6\%), combined pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~13.4\%, 95\% CI: 7.3-19.2\%) and cardiorespiratory events (rVE~=~17.9\%, 95\% CI: 15.0-20.8\%). Reductions in mortality due to pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~39.9\%, 95\% CI: 18.6-55.6\%) and cardiorespiratory causes (rVE~=~27.7\%, 95\% CI: 13.2-32.0\%) were also observed. Similar pooled rVEs were observed in both matched and mismatched seasons and in seasons where A/H3N2 or A/H1N1 strains were predominantly circulating. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence over 10 consecutive influenza seasons and in more than 34 million individuals aged~{$\geq~$}65~years suggests that HD-IIV3 is consistently more effective than SD-IIV at reducing influenza cases as well as influenza-associated clinical complications irrespective of circulating strain and antigenic match.

The continued evolution of the A(H7N9) viruses poses major challenges in pandemic preparedness strategies through vaccination. We assessed the breadth of the heterologous neutralizing antibody responses against the 3rd and 5th wave A(H7N9) viruses using the 1st wave vaccine sera from 4 vaccine groups: 1. inactivated vaccine with 2.8 {\textmu}g hemagglutinin (HA)/dose + AS03A; 2. inactivated vaccine with 5.75 {\textmu}g HA/dose + AS03A; 3. inactivated vaccine with 11.5 {\textmu}g HA/dose + MF59; and 4. recombinant virus like particle (VLP) vaccine with 15 {\textmu}g HA/dose + ISCOMATRIX™. Vaccine group 1 had the highest antibody responses to the vaccine virus and the 3rd/5th wave drifted viruses. Notably, the relative levels of cross-reactivity to the drifted viruses as measured by the antibody GMT ratios to the 5th wave viruses were similar across all 4 vaccine groups. The 1st wave vaccines induced robust responses to the 3rd and Pearl River Delta lineage 5th wave viruses but lower cross-reactivity to the highly pathogenic 5th wave A(H7N9) virus. The population in the United States was largely immunologically naive to the A(H7N9) HA. Seasonal vaccination induced cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition and binding antibodies to N9, but minimal cross-reactive antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies to A(H7N9).},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses. Features Integrates working code into the main text Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub.},

  abstract = {Most humans have pre-existing immunity to influenza viruses. In this study, volunteers (ages of 18--85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated Fluzone™ influenza vaccine in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016 seasons. The impact of repeated vaccination on breadth and durability of antibodies was assessed as a result of vaccine strain changes. Total IgG anti-hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity increased in all age groups against both influenza A HA components in the vaccine post-vaccination (day 21). However, younger subjects maintained seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains, which resulted in higher seroconversion rates in the elderly, since the HAI titers in elderly subjects were more likely to decline prior to the next season. Young subjects had significant HAI activity against historical, as well as contemporary H1 and H3 vaccine strains from the mid-1980s to present. In contrast, elderly subjects had HAI activity to H1 strains from all years, but were more likely to have HAI activity to older strains from 1918-1950s. They also had a more restricted HAI profile against H3 viruses compared to young subjects recognizing H3N2 influenza viruses from the mid-2000s to present. Vaccine recipients were then categorized by whether subjects seroconverted from a seronegative or seropositive pre-vaccination state. Regardless of age, immunological recall or `back-boosting' to antigenically related strains were associated with seroconversion to the vaccine strain. Overall, both younger and older people have the ability to mount a breadth of immune responses following influenza vaccination. This report describes how imprinting exposure differs across age groups, influences antibody cross-reactivity to past hemagglutinin antigenic variants, and shapes immune responses elicited by current split inactivated influenza vaccines. Understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by pre-existing immunity in people of different ages is critical for designing the next-generation of `universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines.},

We quantify the dynamics of protective immunity by fitting  individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and  adults. We find that most protection in children but not adults correlates with  antibody titers to the hemagglutinin surface protein. Protection against  circulating strains wanes to half of peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in  both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09.  Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results  suggest that influenza antibody responses shift focus with age from the mutable  hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the theory of original  antigenic sin, and might affect protection. Imprinting, or primary infection with  a subtype, has modest to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended  infections in adults.},

Immunization regimens, including a delayed fractional third dose, were assessed for potential increased protection against malaria and immunologic responses.Methods.{$\quad$}In a phase 2a, controlled, open-label, study of healthy malaria-naive adults, 16 subjects vaccinated with a 0-, 1-, and 2-month full-dose regimen (012M) and 30 subjects who received a 0-, 1-, and 7-month regimen, including a fractional third dose (Fx017M), underwent CHMI 3 weeks after the last dose. Plasmablast heavy and light chain immunoglobulin messenger RNA sequencing and antibody avidity were evaluated. Protection against repeat CHMI was evaluated after 8 months.Results.{$\quad$}A total of 26 of 30 subjects in the Fx017M group (vaccine efficacy [VE], 86.7\% [95\% confidence interval [CI], 66.8\%--94.6\%]; P \&lt; .0001) and 10 of 16 in the 012M group (VE, 62.5\% [95\% CI, 29.4\%--80.1\%]; P = .0009) were protected against infection, and protection differed between schedules (P = .040, by the log rank test). The fractional dose boosting increased antibody somatic hypermutation and avidity and sustained high protection upon rechallenge.Discussions.{$\quad$}A delayed third fractional vaccine dose improved immunogenicity and protection against infection. Optimization of the RTS,S/AS01 immunization regimen may lead to improved approaches against malaria.Clinical Trials Registration.{$\quad$}NCT01857869.},

Applying these established methods in the field of vaccine development may reduce the currently large clinical trial sample sizes, long time frames, high costs, and ultimately have a better potential to save lives. We propose the field of immunostimulation/immunodynamic (IS/ID) modelling, which aims to translate mathematical frameworks used for drug dosing towards optimizing vaccine dose decision-making. Analogous to Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling, the mathematical description of drug distribution (PK) and effect (PD) in host, IS/ID modelling approaches apply mathematical models to describe the underlying mechanisms by which the immune response is stimulated by vaccination (IS) and the resulting measured immune response dynamics (ID). To move IS/ID modelling forward, existing datasets and further data on vaccine allometry and dose-dependent dynamics need to be generated and collate, requiring a collaborative environment with input from academia, industry, regulators, governmental and non-governmental agencies to share modelling expertise, and connect modellers to vaccine data.},

It contains 60~{\textmu}g hemagglutinin of each influenza strain, which is four times the hemagglutinin content of standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluzone (IIV3-SD). IIV3-HD has been licensed for use in older adults in the US since December 2009 and in Canada since February 2016. Areas covered: In this review, we summarize postlicensure studies on the immunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of IIV3-HD and estimates of its cost-effectiveness in older adults. We also discuss the potential application of IIV3-HD in adults 50-64~years of age and in individuals who may respond poorly to standard-dose influenza vaccines. Expert commentary: Multiple studies conducted since 2004 have consistently shown that, in older adults, IIV3-HD induces substantially greater antibody responses and better protection against influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization than IIV3-SD. Health economic analyses suggest that IIV3-HD can be a cost-effective alternative to standard-dose trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines and can even be cost-saving compared to IIV3-SD in older adults. Further investigation of IIV3-HD vaccination as a way to improve immune responses and protection against influenza in immunocompromised individuals is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background Vaccine supply shortages are of global concern. We hypothesise that intradermal (ID) immunisation as an alternative to standard routes might augment vaccine supply utilisation without loss of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis searching Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if: licensed, currently available vaccines were used; fractional dose of ID was compared to IM or SC immunisation; primary immunisation schedules were evaluated; immunogenicity, safety data and/or cost were reported. We calculated risk differences (RD). Studies were included in meta-analysis if: a pre-defined immune correlate of protection was assessed; WHO-recommend schedules and antigen doses were used in the control group; the same schedule was applied to both ID and control groups (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020151725). Results The primary search yielded 5,873 articles, of which 156 articles were included; covering 12 vaccines. Non-inferiority of immunogenicity with 20--60\% of antigen used with ID vaccines was demonstrated for influenza (H1N1: RD -0{$\cdot$}01; 95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}02, 0{$\cdot$}01; I2 = 55\%, H2N3: RD 0{$\cdot$}00; 95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}01, 0{$\cdot$}01; I2 = 0\%, B: RD -0{$\cdot$}00; 95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}02, 0{$\cdot$}01; I2 = 72\%), rabies (RD 0{$\cdot$}00; 95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}02, 0{$\cdot$}02; I2 = 0\%), and hepatitis B vaccines (RD -0{$\cdot$}01; 95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}04, 0{$\cdot$}02; I2 = 20\%). Clinical trials on the remaining vaccines yielded promising results, but are scarce. Conclusions There is potential for inoculum/antigen dose-reduction by using ID immunisation as compared to standard routes of administration for some vaccines (e.g. influenza, rabies). When suitable, vaccine trials should include an ID arm.},

It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.}

  abstract = {A successful vaccine development strategy for areas with clustered H5N1 events requires conduct of vaccine trials in potentially non-na{\"i}ve subjects and evaluation of post-vaccination responsiveness. An open-label, randomized, phase I/II study therefore assessed the immunogenicity and safety of two different dose levels of an inactivated, non-adjuvanted, whole virus clade 2.1 (A/Indonesia/05/2005) H5N1 Vero cell-derived influenza vaccine in healthy adults (21-45 years) from a region where the virus has been circulating (Hong Kong) as well as Singapore. Subjects (N=110) were randomized 1:1 to receive two vaccinations with either 3.75 {$\mu$}g or 7.5 {$\mu$}g H5N1 haemagglutinin antigen 21 days apart. Safety, immunogenicity (microneutralization [MN] and single radial haemolysis [SRH] at baseline and post-vaccination) and cross-reactivity against a heterologous clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) of the vaccine were assessed. Pre-existing immunity to the vaccine strain was 14\% which is higher than previously reported for these regions. Two vaccinations with either vaccine formulation induced high seroprotection rates (MN titre {$\geq$} 1:20) against the vaccine strain A/Indonesia/05/2005: 82.7\% and 86.5\% in the 3.75 {$\mu$}g and 7.5 {$\mu$}g dose groups. Seroconversion rates and fold increase exceeded the CPMP criterion of {$>$}40\% and {$>$}2.5 for MN and SRH in both dose groups after the second vaccination, while the seroprotection rate in the 7.5 {$\mu$}g dose group determined by SRH was only marginally lower (69.2\%) than the CPMP criterion of {$>$}70\%. Thus, 11 of 12 CHMP criteria were fulfilled. A cross-reactive antibody response against the heterologous A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain was demonstrated after the second vaccination ({$>$}21\% by MN and {$\geq$} 25\% by SRH). Persistence of antibodies against the vaccine strain was also demonstrated 6 months after the first vaccination, indicating that a booster vaccination would be effective in those who have received two priming doses. No serious adverse events were reported. The H5N1 influenza vaccine against clade 2.1 strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 was well tolerated and immunogenic after two vaccinations, and induced a cross-neutralizing antibody response, with no dose effect.},

Although influenza A viruses are perceived to carry greater risk because they account for the majority of influenza cases in most seasons and have been responsible for influenza pandemics, influenza B viruses also impose a substantial public health burden, particularly among children and at-risk subjects. Furthermore, since the 2001-2002 influenza season, both influenza B lineages, B/Victoria-like viruses and B/Yamagata-like viruses have co-circulated in Europe. The conventional trivalent influenza vaccines have shown a limited ability to induce effective protection when major or minor mismatches between the influenza B vaccine component and circulating strains occur. For this reason, the inclusion of a second B strain in influenza vaccines may help to overcome the well-known difficulties of predicting the circulating B lineage and choosing the influenza B vaccine component. Two quadrivalent influenza vaccines, a live-attenuated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) and a split inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (I/QIV), were first licensed in the US in 2012. Since their introduction, models simulating the inclusion of QIV in influenza immunization programs have demonstrated the substantial health benefits, in terms of reducing the number of influenza cases, their complications and mortality. In the near future, evaluations from simulation models should be confirmed by effectiveness studies in the field, and more costeffectiveness analyses should be conducted in order to verify the expected benefits.},

Importantly, we show that increasing the vaccine dose can overcome this impediment, resulting in improved vaccine-induced circulating and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cell responses, which were protective against heterologous influenza challenge.

However, the traditional intramuscular (IM) immunization causes fear, pain, and cross infection. In contrast, needle-free (NF) immunization is quick and easy for medical personnel and painless and safe for patients. In this study, we assessed the safety and protective efficacy of NF intradermal (ID) immunization with the influenza H7N9 split vaccine (Anhui H7N9/PR8). A preliminary safety evaluation showed that ID immunization with 15~{$\mu$}g of the H7N9 influenza vaccine was not toxic in rats. Moreover, the antigen was metabolized more rapidly after ID than after IM immunization, as determined by in vivo imaging, and ID immunization accelerated the generation of a specific immune response. Additionally, ID immunization with a 20\% dose of the H7N9 split vaccine Anhui H7N9/PR8 offered complete protection against lethal challenge by the live H7N9 virus. Taken together, our findings suggest that NF ID immunization with the H7N9 influenza vaccine induces effective protection, has a good safety profile, requires little antigen, and elicits an immune response more rapidly than does IM immunization. This approach may be used to improve the control of influenza H7N9 outbreaks.},
